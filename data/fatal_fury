and his brother Andy are adopted by Jeff Bogard, only for Jeff to be killed in front of them by his former rival Geese Howard. Determined, the brothers spend the next decade training to become stronger, meeting new allies like Joe Higashi and Mai Shiranui, before returning to South Town to participate in the 'King of Fighters' fighting tournament being held by Geese. After winning the tournament, Terry and Geese have a showdown at the top of Geese Tower, and Geese is sent falling from the building, believed to be dead. One year later in Fatal Fury 2, Geese's half brother Wolfgang Krauser hosts a new global King of Fighters tournament in a bid to draw out Geese's killers and prove himself stronger. At the end of the tournament, Terry defeats Krauser, who is said to have taken his own life in shame.","In Fatal Fury 3, set three years later, Terry and his friends learn that Geese survived his fall using a magic scroll, and now seeks to recover the three legendary Sacred Scrolls of Jin, said to imbue their user with great power. With the scrolls spotted in South Town, Terry and the others race to recover the scrolls before Geese while also contending with Jin Chonshu and Jin Chonrei, two Chinese orphans possessed by the spirits of their ancestors that seek to use the scrolls to resurrect themselves. Geese recovers the scrolls, but chooses to destroy them so they cannot be used against him. In Real Bout: Fatal Fury, to assert his power, Geese holds another 'King of Fighters' tournament, which culminates in a final battle between him and Terry. Geese is once again knocked from his tower, and though Terry tries to save him, Geese refuses and willingly falls to his death. Seeking to end the cycle of violence, Terry decides to raise Geese's now orphaned young son, Rock Howard.","Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 also serves as a side story of the characters' current whereabouts, ten years prior to Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Terry and the now grown up Rock are invited to participate in the new 'King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem' tournament. They later learn that it was organized by Rock's maternal uncle, Kain R. Heinlein, who seeks to use Geese's legacy to make Second Southtown an independent city-state. When Kain reveals that Rock's mother Marie is still alive, Rock leaves Terry to go with Kain in order to learn the truth and save his mother. One year later in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, Kain's investigations determine Marie has been held captive by Mr. Big, who demands Geese's legacy in exchange for her freedom. Billy Kane reveals to Rock that Geese's legacy includes the Sacred Scrolls, which Billy had preserved and given Geese fakes of to destroy. Before Billy can give Rock the legacy, all of it is stolen by an unknown figure.","Days later, a new King of Fighters tournament is announced by Franz Stroheim, with the stolen legacy offered as the prize. Rock, Kain, Billy, Terry, and several others enter the tournament to retrieve the legacy and rescue Marie. While Rock and Terry manage to enter the finals at Geese Tower, Kain and Billy are able to cooperate with Mr. Big on protecting Marie from their enemy forces. Suddenly, Marie got in a crossfire between Mr. Big and his former underling, Jack Turner, causing the Jin scrolls somehow react to Rock, and has the boy become possessed by a spirit of the third Jin brother, and assume an attire resembles' Geese, dubbed 'Fallen Rock'. While Terry and the others hold off the possessed Rock, Rock is fighting to regain his body inside his mind. Before Rock returns to normal and awakens, he and Billy receive respective visions that reveal the truth behind Geese's good reason to abandon him and Marie, and his family's relation with the Jin dynasty through Geese and Wolfgang's father, Rudolph Krauser. The reason Rock serves as the third Jin brother's reincarnation instead of Geese, Wolfgang nor Rudolph is because he and his distant relatives, the modern day Jin twins Chonrei and Chonshu are the same generation with similar desires. With all three ancestral Jin brothers defeated, the reincarnation curse which caused by their father has been lifted, reuniting the trio in the afterlife. Having finally reunited with his mother, who currently resides with her brother, Kain, Rock decides to forge his own brighter path as his late father wanted and thanks Terry for raising him, while Billy decides to protect and honor the Howard family's legacy.","Several other Fatal Fury games have been released, though these games' stories are not a part of the main series canon. These include Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition, which retells the story of the original game with characters from later entries, and Real Bout Fatal Fury Special: Dominated Mind, in which new protagonist Alfred stops the evil White from filling the power vacuum in South Town after Geese's death."],"otherMedia":[{"title":"Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf","type":"Anime OVA","releaseYear":1992,"description":"The first Fatal Fury anime OVA, adapting the original game’s story of Terry, Andy, and Joe fighting against Geese Howard.","durationMinutes":45,"directedBy":"Hiroshi Fukutomi","image":"https://koenraadp.github.io/integratie-eindopdracht2-data/images/othermedia01.jpg"},{"title":"Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle","type":"Anime OVA","releaseYear":1993,"description":"A sequel to the first OVA, featuring the introduction of Wolfgang Krauser as a new antagonist.","durationMinutes":60,"directedBy":"Kazuhiro Furuhashi","image":"https://koenraadp.github.io/integratie-eindopdracht2-data/images/othermedia02.jpg"},{"title":"Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture","type":"Anime Movie","releaseYear":1994,"description":"A full-length animated film that departs from the game storyline and introduces an original plot with the antagonist Laocorn Gaudeamus.","durationMinutes":95,"directedBy":"Shigenori Kageyama","image":"https://koenraadp.github.io/integratie-eindopdracht2-data/images/othermedia03.jpg"},{"title":"Garou Densetsu: Senritsu no Maō","type":"Manga","releaseYear":1994,"description":"A manga adaptation based on the Fatal Fury games, serialized in Comic BomBom.","author":"Ken Ishikawa","volumes":1,"image":"https://koenraadp.github.io/integratie-eindopdracht2-data/images/othermedia04.jpg"},{"title":"Garou Densetsu 3","type":"Manga","releaseYear":1995,"description":"A manga based on Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory, published in Japan.","author":"Katsuya Terada","volumes":1,"image":"https://koenraadp.github.io/integratie-eindopdracht2-data/images/othermedia05.png"}]}
